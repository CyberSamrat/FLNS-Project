## Features

- **Port Scanning**: TCP connect scans for specified or common ports.
- **Service Version Detection**: Identifies running services and versions (HTTP/S, SSH, FTP, SMTP).
- **Web Vulnerability Detection**:
  - Checks for missing HTTP security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.).
  - Detects common sensitive files/directories (`robots.txt`, `.git/config`, etc.).
  - Basic XSS detection by parsing HTML.
- **DNS Information Lookup**: Retrieves A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, SOA, TXT records, plus reverse DNS lookups.
- **Subdomain Enumeration**:
  - Brute-forces common subdomains.
  - Uses `crt.sh` to gather subdomains from Certificate Transparency logs.
- **Colored Output**: User-friendly colored terminal output for better readability.
- **Output Logging**: Saves detailed results in CSV format for later analysis.

## Requirements

- **Python** 3.x

### Required Python Libraries:

**requests** :-   For making HTTP requests.

2. Check if Python 3 is installed:
```bash
python3 --version
```
3. If Python 3 is not installed, install it via:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3
```
4. Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 colorama dnspython
```

## Usage
```bash
python3 flns.py
```

## Example
```yaml
command: "python3 flns.py"
  banner: 
                   ______ _       _   _  _____

## How It Works
- The script provides a menu-driven interface to perform various network reconnaissance tasks:

- Port Scanning: Uses Python socket with ThreadPoolExecutor for concurrent TCP connection scanning.

- Service Version Detection: Sends protocol-specific probes (like HTTP GET) and parses responses.

- Web Vulnerability Detection:

- Checks HTTP headers for missing security policies.

- Looks for sensitive files (robots.txt, .git/config, etc.).

- Uses BeautifulSoup for basic XSS pattern detection in HTML content.

- DNS Information Lookup: Uses dnspython for querying DNS records and performs reverse DNS lookup via socket.gethostbyaddr.

- Subdomain Enumeration:

- Brute-force: Attempts resolving common subdomain names.

- CRT.sh: Retrieves subdomains listed in Certificate Transparency logs via HTTP requests.

- Output Management: Results saved optionally in CSV format using Pythonâ€™s csv module.
